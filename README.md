This project involves the creation of a plant leaf disease detection system using Python, employing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as the deep learning algorithm. The system is designed to predict the presence of 38 different diseases affecting plant leaves. The dataset utilized for training and testing the CNN model is sourced from Kaggle.
